      9 AM Continental flight from LA to Honolulu, arriving 11:30 AM. Before takeoff I was about to change seats, having been placed in the wrong section where there was no meal service. I was placed in the first seat behind first class where no movie is shown and smoking is permitted. The seat next to me was vacant and it turned out to be an excellent window seat with no seats in front and more legroom. Al, the in-flight supervisor, buckled up in the vacant seat on takeoff and offered me free drinks because of the seat change.</div>

      <p>Our complete tour group of 47 got together for the first time for an orientation at a complimentary breakfast held on the floating restaurant Oceania. We met our tour guide, Lani, who was to travel with us from island to island and take care of any problems we might have. The oldest member of our group (around 80) had an early sinking spell and fell asleep during breakfast. Since he was traveling alone, we took him under our wing, calling his room when he forgot to show up for tours he'd paid for. After signing up for a dinner cruise on Kona, he forgot and ate dinner before we cruised. He was a very interesting fellow to talk to, and had led an active life including several inventions and patents along with working as a film technologist with old stars like Mae West and Gary Cooper.</p></div>

      <p>Bags were packed this morning for our 2 PM flight to Kauai on Aloha Airlines. Before leaving Oahu I spent a couple of hours shopping at the marketplace and located pendants with coral stones for the girls. I purchased a teriyaki burger which I took back to my balcony, and enjoyed the last views of Waikiki before boarding our airport bus at 12:30.</p>
      <p>A short wait for our flight out of Honolulu allowed us time for a piña colada at the airport bar, and we were off for our second island.</p></div>

      <p>Kauai, known as the quiet isle, was the perfect place for a “day of rest.” Passing up the canyon tour for the day (later regretted) it was like being on an island all alone. Except for a couple of notes written, the entire day was spent lying in a secluded area and taking in the beauty all around. Paper bags and magazines remained unopened, and paradise was spoiled only once when the nearby active surf washed up a “Big Mac” carton right beneath my feet --- how tacky!</p></div>

      <p>After my day of rest I awoke early but confused as the Good Morning America Show was forecasting the weekend weather. It took a while before I realized that this quiet little island got their Friday news on Monday. The late late show also starts at 10 PM. Having no dinner that evening before, I had a ravishing appetite and put away a big breakfast at the hotel. Afterward, a more thorough shopping spree in the nearby shopping mall and the purchase of a gold charm holder for my own remembrance.</p></div>

      <p>Bags were due out early for our longest flight between the islands, 50 minutes, from Kauai to Hawaii. A temporary moment of concern hit when I heard an unnatural sound in my room and realized I packed my alarm before it went off --- which of course was now in full voice all locked up in my case. Breakfast in the hotel and our bus whisked us off to the airport where the x-ray machine showed my fold-up umbrellas as a possible machine gun and had to be examined. Once in the terminal, I saw Marilyn and Cheryl waiting also. It was a beautiful day and a smooth flight to the coast of Kona, and the many pictures taken of the islands from the plane were very clear.</p></div>

      <p>At 9 AM a group of us walked a short distance to the Kona docks where we boarded a boat and took a cruise to Captain Cook's monument. It was a beautiful day and a scenic coastline cruise. The highlight of my entire trip was the half hour stop over at the cove of Cook's monument. Snorkeling gear and masks were provided for those who wished to “jump overboard” and see the underwater sites. A diver was sent down to put out bait, and this drew many beautiful fish into view. Combined with the awesome coral formation it was an unforgettable experience! On the return trip hotdogs and wine tasted great after our half hour swim, and we returned to shore at noon.</p></div>

      <p>Our day started early with our group boarding a tour bus which would take us from Kona to Hilo. Our driver, Danny, had been driving that route for 10 years and made the day a great experience. He made a hit with me right away when he said he enjoyed his job because the people were always different - “Like you, wow” he grinned. Naturally he got a good tip.</p>
      <p>As we toured along the coast and across the island, he stopped and broke off branches of Macadamia trees, coffee trees etc. to pass around so we could see how they grew. We also saw sugar cane, bananas, papaya, guava, coconuts, and others. We passed by Jimmy Stewart's macadamia ranch and his ranch sign was out near the highway.</p></div>

      <p>Another early start at 7:30 AM, and I caught a bus in front of my hotel for an 8 AM sailing out of Lahaina Harbor to the privately owned pineapple island of Lanai. In fact, we heard that Dole has the island up for sale, and several of us pretended we were land speculators and prospective buyers. Our labels definitely spelled out lookie-loos however!</p></div>

      <p>After taking a few pictures around the hotel, I headed to the beach for my last day of Hawaiian sun. About 11 AM, a girl was out rounding up a group for a catamaran sail at noon, next door at the Sheraton. Not being able to resist a boat ride, off I went forty minutes later. It was a beautiful sail along the Maui coast on a brand new vessel that was really comfortable - and no splashes. I met a couple from Hong Kong who were visiting California and Hawaii for the first time. He was originally from Sweden and she was from Florence. I couldn't keep from admiring her beautiful figure. She was mid fifties with a golden tan and trim body sporting a brief white bikini. I asked her secret, but wasn't surprised to find out she's a rich lady of leisure who plays tennis daily and has massages regularly.</p></div>

      <p>We breakfasted early at the hotel and boarded a bus for the Maui airport, where we went through a customs search of all our luggage. On the way to the airport, I finally saw one of those beautiful Hawaiian rainbows arched over the sugarcane fields. A short Aloha flight to Honolulu where we used our 1 1/2 hour layover to purchase fresh leies to take home. It was the first time since Los Angeles that I had to present a ticket to the ticket agent for a boarding pass. All that had been done for us by our agent. I requested the same seat I had on my trip over and was delighted to find it was available.</p></div>
